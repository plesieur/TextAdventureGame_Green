Some of the bug notes have been posted in the CS files.

NOTES:
- Typing 'go' and then the name of a character caises a crash and gives the following message:
  "System.IndexOutOfRangeException: 'Index was outside the bounds of the array.'"

- Typing 'examine' and the name of suspect does nothing and gives the following message in the console:
  "That doesn't exist. Let that sink in."

- Not sure if this is a bug, but whenever 'push' and the name of a suspect is typed it just says "[suspect]: reaction".

- Typing "go [direction]" or just "[direction]" makes no difference. Why is 'go' a command?

- I'm still able to talk to suspects when there's none in the room I'm in.
